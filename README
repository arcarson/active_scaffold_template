== Welcome to my Active Scaffold template

I think that simple features should be cheap, and complex features should be
proportionately more expensive. Traditional CMSs give you simple features for
free, but complex features are costly. I'm using the cost of a feature to
mean a combination of development time and technical debt.

I've used admin systems like this for several years of professional work on
small and medium sized websites and applications. They have made creation of
admin areas trivial. Beyond the obvious benefits in time savings I find it's
incredibly helpful to have clients begin entering real data as early in a
project as possible.

I am using minimal automated testing for admin areas. The description of how
admin functionality should behave is so high level that it's just configuation.
I see no more benefit in testing this configuration than in asserting that my
database.yml has it's development adapter set to sqlite3.
